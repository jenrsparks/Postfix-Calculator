Postfix-Calculator
=====================

This project contains a simple postfix calculator written in C++ in Fall 2007 at Maryville University. It is currently limited to single digit numbers because of the method of input, though I do hope to improve this in the future.

Information about postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish notation, can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation

Usage:

A general formula to be entered would be "34+" which would provide a result of '7'. Supported operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (*).

Planned Features:

- Digits greater than 9 supported
- Input format changed to include spaces between numbers and operators
- Support for division
